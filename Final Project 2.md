# MORE DEVELOPED FINAL PROJECT IDEA

"*DIY LO-FI*"

![DIY LO-FI Sketch](Images/final%20sketch%20lofi.jpg)

## Possible Ideas

Have a base beat for audience

Objects have different sounds that play and add to the music

certain ones have sound affects tht relate to the object, some dont, some play different layered beats

how to allow some things to loop while others just play once

have a loop button

replay button?

end button

## Objects & Sounds

MORE THEMED

**Traffic Cone**- *honk* or *blinker*

**Piggy Bank**- *oink* or "*cha-ching*"

**Lighter**- *ligther click* or *bong bubble*

**Candle Holder**- *crying* or *praying* ?

**Door Knob**- *door creak* or *fun knock*

LESS THEMED

**Perfume Bottle**- *seagull call* or *car alarm* ?

**Paper Clip Remover**- *alien spaceship sounds* or *bird chirping*

Daisy microcontroller chomi - sound software

## Brainstorm

how can I **save my song and take it with me?** *you cant*

Organize objects into a new one?

Form into the structure of a radio/ jutebox / dj turn table? (music editor)

have objects use found sound to allow the viewer to create their own lo-fi song

have buttons/switches to *loop sounds*? or can that be done with the speed and actual turn table spin

needs to be clean and asthetic, *but how can it be hands on? what else can move? how can it be more dynamic?*

touch something to choose the object wrather than physically grabbing

change in tone?

### What people can Control

1. Choose Your Base Track (1)
2. Place Objects to Create Sounds
3. Loop Sounds

Are there certain random or unexpected elements?

### Mechanics and Logistics

What kind of sensor is best to use

are the sounds specific to the objects? sensor specific or do people just think it is

*midi controllers* (physical output to midi)

Back up idea??

"*i will spend the rest of my life hiding the shaking of my hands*"

using a machine to create anxiety

leg tapping

repetative movements and twitches triggered by...

people coming closer? loud sounds? the louder and more stimulated, the more visually indicative of stress

other random idea: random stuff with knives? *chopping and dicing*

# MORE DEVELOPED FINAL PROJECT IDEA

"*DIY LO-FI*"

![DIY LO-FI Sketch](Images/final%20sketch%20lofi.jpg)

## Possible Ideas

Have a base beat for audience

Objects have different sounds that play and add to the music

certain ones have sound affects tht relate to the object, some dont, some play different layered beats

how to allow some things to loop while others just play once

have a loop button

replay button?

end button

## Objects & Sounds

MORE THEMED

**Traffic Cone**- *honk* or *blinker*

**Piggy Bank**- *oink* or "*cha-ching*"

**Lighter**- *ligther click* or *bong bubble*

**Candle Holder**- *crying* or *praying* ?

**Door Knob**- *door creak* or *fun knock*

LESS THEMED

**Perfume Bottle**- *seagull call* or *car alarm* ?

**Paper Clip Remover**- *alien spaceship sounds* or *bird chirping*

## Brainstorm

how can I **save my song and take it with me?**

Organize objects into a new one?

Form into the structure of a radio/ jutebox / dj turn table? (music editor)

have objects use found sound to allow the viewer to create their own lo-fi song

# Week 8

## Continued Progress on Midterm

Q: *"how to make more engaging for audience? what drives people to participate in something?"*

motive and competition

more of a video game incorporate **high scores** to be displayed at the end so people can see how they can compare, want to do better than those before them, maybe they will want to retry to beter results

but *how to we reward them?* or is simply winning reward enough

*display top score to beat* so they have something to wark toward before they start and a goal in mind

set amount of images, when player exceeds that set amount, the images are then adjusted through filters on ps5j *ex: invert, posterize, blur

(these distructive events are heavily repeated in the world, but through build up the more they are repeated the more damage they do, so images are then altered)

every 5 tilts rewards a horse noise, to indicate smaller rewards throughout the game, and keep the play interesting while connecting it to the sensor

have a **game start** between horse uses to indicate it is ready to use again

then a count down will indicate when the player starts the game, starting with the first tilt, to create anticipation while making the experience more dynamic

# Week 11 In-Class Notes

Did not get to complete

Notes for Lab to complete later

IN-CLASS NOTES (3/27)

Keep voltages consistent for ground

connect both black wires together or connect to same blue strip on breadboard

Why do we want to add mechanism of our own?

Change Motion

- acessories that change constant rotary motion

Change where motion happens

- translating movement location

Change speed and power

- direct drive- syncronized
- friction drive-

gears:chains

pulleys:belts

- belt can be figure 8 so pullys go in opposite directions
- pullies can be oriented to change the belt spin
- they are probably stronger due to no fear of slip
- always watn more friction with a belt

Driving pully motor petals

Driven is along for the ride

** As things get slower they get more powerful

idler- spring ust along for the ride, keeps chains tight as chain stretches and gear sizes change

GEAR TALK

10 teeth(1000rpm)  100 teeth (100 rpm)

1/10 speed

stacked gears

add 100 tooth gear

brings speed down to 10 rpm

Spur gear- classic cartoon looking gear

Planetary gears- individual gears going around a thing like solar stystem model

6 SIMPLE MACHINES

- wheel and axel
- lever (categorized by classes, 1-3) (pivot point, force, load)
- inclined plane
- pullies
- screws (inlcines plane spun aorund on axis)
- wedge

GEAR RATIO

- Gear boxes

- compound gear set, multiply ratios together

- 5:1 x 5:1 x 4:1 = 100:1

GEAR TYPES

- Some mesh with a chain
- some mesh with other gears

when gears connect, they go opposite ways, added gear will channge motion back

each gear tooth is like an individual level, touching at precise points

Cam for each axis

cam follower connects and stabilizes cams

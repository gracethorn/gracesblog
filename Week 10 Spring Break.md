- how do i get people to inter act and **play** with this project
- How literal do I need to be so people feel comforatble enough and *drawn* to interacting with the piece
- *spray painted objects* everyone always telling me they want to touch or take a bite out of the objects, how can I exploit this subconscious reaction that I have received from many

start looking for more spray paint objects as well, *this could work...*

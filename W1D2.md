# Week 1 Day 2 (Jan 17) Lab Video Notes

1.BASICS OF ELECTRICITY

  AC vs DC:
 AC

* wall socket
* volitile
* 110 V to 120 V AC 
* 60hz in US

DC

* batteries
* constant
* positive/negative

Alternating current ~~~~
Direct current ------

WHAT WE MEASURE

* volts (v) (E)
* current (A) (I)
* resistence (Ohms)
* Ohms (V= IR) (volts= current x resistence)
* Find whatts: P/IxE

2.HOW A BREADBOARD WORKS

-Make wire stable using wire cutters and bending
-Virticle lanes connected to eachother ut does not travel horizontal across lanes
Outside blue (+) and red (-) lines run horizonal

3.FLASHLIGHT CIRCUIT

-put in LED
-trim down resister and wire to cut out future problems
-black to blue
red to red
battery t board
register legs, through register to ground, other to power

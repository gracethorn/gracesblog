# Week 1 Day 2 (Jan 17) Lab Video Notes

## BASICS OF ELECTRICITY

### AC vs DC

#### AC

* wall socket
* volitile
* 110 V to 120 V AC
* 60hz in US

#### DC

* batteries
* constant
* positive/negative

Alternating current:~~~~

Direct current: ------

#### WHAT WE MEASURE

* volts (v) (E)
* current (A) (I)
* resistence (Ohms)
* Ohms (V= IR) (volts= current x resistence)
* Find whatts: P/I(E)

## HOW A BREADBOARD WORKS

-Make wire stable using wire cutters and bending

-Virticle lanes connected to eachother ut does not travel horizontal across lanes

-Outside blue (+) and red (-) lines run horizonal

## FLASHLIGHT CIRCUIT

-put in LED

-trim down resister and wire to cut out future problems

-black to blue (ground)

-red to red (power)

-battery to board

-register legs, through register to ground, other to power

## SCHEMATICS AND DIAGRAMS

## COMPONENTS IN THE FLASHLIGHT CIRCUIT

### LED Structure

(insert image)

#### -Positive Parts

* large wire inside light
* flattened part on ridge
* long leg

#### %5 Gold Resister

Colored lines
(ex: 10,000 whatts)

* First #: 1 - brown
* Second #: 0 - black
* Number of 0's left: 3 - orange

Value  -  Color
0 - black
1 - brown
2 - red
3 - orange
4 - yellow
5 - green
6 - blue
7 - violet
8 - grey
9 - white

## LAB 1: the flashlight

-volts are **PUSHED**
-currents **PULLS/DRAWS**

## LAB 2: voltage dividers

### Voltage divider

* COM (black)
* VmA (red)
* put it on *next highest* number for precision
* 2 ends of registers touching
* 10k patentiager
* ADJUST VOLT OUTPUT

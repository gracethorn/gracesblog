# FINAL PROJECT brainstorm & share w/ craig

Okay so I am just going to list music and sounds that I would have used if I was doing this project solo, feel free to not use any I just wanted to be honest in what I was originally looking at but I don’t mind going in other directions. In a lot of my artwork I reference music and shows/movies that are my favorites and try to slip them in wherever I can, so that is where these come from. I know some might work a lot better than others, but just wanted to contribute with ideas :)

*Grapejuice*- by **Harry Styles**

- Just has some interesting sound effects and distortions.

**Bojack Horseman** intro *Bojack's Theme*

- Against just cool sound effects, bits of sax and just nice sound I am always drawn to, (no skip intro for me in general)

**Bojack Outro** too honestly *Back in the 90's*

- There is a sheep “baaaa” that I find funny but might be too short and quiet

Would love a *mix of like good sounds and then funny unexpected moments*

**Wilhelm scream sound effect**, just so notable and recognizable similar to some of the objects, even with no relation conceptually

**Clock ticking / metronome / car blinker** for clock object, may be too on the nose but might be cool

*To Be So Lonely*- by**Harry Styles**

- Guitar finger pluck

**Cowboy Bebop** Intro *“Tank!”* or other jazzy stuff

**Gravity Falls Intro** the *Reverse Segment* at end

**Billie Eilish songs and sounds**, she often uses found sound and repeated samplings in her songs (ex: *Changed My Number* (dog snort at beginning), *Bad Guy* (traffic crosswalk sound), *GLOLDWING* (sampling singing at start of song and using it as the base beat).

*Persona 5 game soundtrack*, I often find sounds or base music for art projects

- Animal Crossing talking sound

- Children giggle (enforce play, everyday normal sound)

- Iconic phone alarm, *how do people respond, are they less likely to use that sound out of reflex?*

Have some sounds work better for looping while others are more intentional and placed on beat, let the audience figure this out?

Priority in all of my work is really to just **have fun w it**, from the start of the process to the final result and user interaction. Anything you would like to include or would have fun working with please go ahead and use whatever would make you happiest.

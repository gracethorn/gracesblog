# Midterm Restults and Notes

## Documentation of Work

(*enter photo and video documentation of Horse Interactice piece*)

## Project Description & Ideas

PLAY. BURN. SLEEP. REPEAT.

Ideas of mindless destruction

"**We are all *only?* children.**"

What the average child sees now adays, the destruction of the world around them, rather than the joys of childhood, and when they grow up they will continue this damaging cycle

How what your innocent actions oten cuase more damage and distuction than you think

### What Worked Well?

Horse is function, could support the weight of users

Tilt sensation works well, makes th user work for it and increases its interactivitity

Shoe prints give subtle signal viewer to participate without standing out

### Things to Fix

How should the piece atart? On a black screen so it isnt clear at first, or does the stagnat fire invite the viewer to to cuase action, is there a better way to do thsi and provoke the viewer to inact a change

NEED BETTER PORJECTOR SET UP OVERALL

Clear up the quality and legibility of the images

## How I Plan to Build This Concept

Now that I have the basic technical elements I hope to expand in order to make more of a game structures experience in order to entertain the viewer, using the recklessness of competition

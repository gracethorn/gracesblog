## How to Make a PCB prototype using the Carbide Nomad CnC

**FUSION 360**- *where 3D modeling takes place, professional software*

gerber

each gerber is one layer of your board

ncdrill file places and poits on board here drill bit needs to be

g code language for cnc machines

ncfile

insure units are the same, in millimeters

offset will bring it away from corner
knowing exacly where it is for where you cut

fix: *have zero as offset it will be easier over, ou can choose starting point*

thickness is important so it does cut through too much and so it doesnt barely scratch surface

Copper carbite is flipped/mirrored, and shows the bottom of the board

gerber file is from the top

vbit-  v shaped bit, cuts down to make correct cut width

cuts trouph around circuit
you can increase sixe for more isolation

coppercarbide only had drill bits, cant make slots

board outline

while you can export another gerber, let it create in carbide copper

can save all the gcode filse together as one

or you can save them seperately into a zip file, this always feels safer

WHY NOT TO USE COPPER CARBIDE

weird shaped boards

any slots

lots of diff size hold

cutting in one pass is a little to much for machine or what you are looking for

Circuit board

one side copper

other side fiber glass

design rules check- just makes sure you are not breaking nay rules, too small or things too close together

factory check, make sure they can make it before being sent over

distance between circuit pins *how far pins on sensors, and ho far breadboard pnis are*

2.54 millimeter

.1 inch

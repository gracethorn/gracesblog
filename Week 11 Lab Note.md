# Week 11 Lab Notes: (Motor Control w BJT, MOSFET, Relays & L293D)

## (AND CLASS NOTES)

Learn how *Arduino can cntrl larger devices tru translators, MOSFETs & relays*

## Using Translator as Switch

Transistors can be used to switch electricity without moving parts.

Transistor in kit is PN2222, cheap and common NPN transistor.

Some example NPN transistors that could replace: *BC547, 2N2222, AND 2N3904*

pnp transistors work diff and cant be used in same way

Basic use of transistor as switch:

- when right amt of current flows into Base, transistor will allow current to pass, Collector > Emitter

Load is abovice Collector, transistor Emitter cnt to ground.

## Lab Class Notes (4/10)

transistor *can act as amplifier and a switch*

**source current**: *connect* LED to *output*, get current and *pull* it *to ground*

- if we ask to **pull** voltage (^) up we are asking it to **sink** current

- *different* in how well they *source vs sink*

serial.write sends a byte

*WEBSITES:* allelectronics, electronics goldmind

*(FOR FINAL?)***--soundplant**- *free online sound sampler sound trigger*

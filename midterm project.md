# Midterm Project

## Project Overall Outline & Structure

Horse at rest displays **blinking "START GAME"**

When horse is first moved **Countdown visual begins** and **countdown sound plays**

Question: *at end of countdown can I get rid of 0 and just disply text?*

Countdown finishes, few seconds go by, **Flame animation begins**

**Game Music Starts** (Player has a certain amount of time to complete action *60sec?*, this will be insinuated by *Pop Goes the Wheesle*)

Each **push** rewards a **randomized image** of destruction/childhood pulled from an array

If first round of images are all used, next file contains *same set of images* but *adjusted by filters, posterize & invert* and are then randomized, next set adjusted more *ensure enough images for any amount of ride* (deteriorating of images)

*images build on top of eachother* overlaying obscuring the animation making it harder to see, makes it more overwhelming, the destruction dosent leave

After certain amount of pushes, noise is played (horse neighs? children laugh screams)

**as time goes on** *sounds become more frequent, loud and intense* adding suspense

Count down when 5 seconds left to encourage greater participation

"TIMES UP." text displayed

**PLAY. SLEEP. BURN. REPEAT.** displayed one after the other

HIGHSCORE vs YOUR SCORE

High scores (top 3) displayed first *display one after other not all at once* and then current player score to show how they compare, *after should keep interest a tad longer*

Compare current player with top three scores:

- if number is higher then winner text displayed
- if number is lower then "try again next time"

Player ends and gets off horse

When motion stops for certain time (20 sec) the animation stats back at beginning "START GAME" screen
  
## Code needs to

Store various images and randomize the array without repeating within groups

store the ending results of each game played and then pull from these results

have a set amount of time for each persons experience, one minute? 60sec?

Store sounds to be played
